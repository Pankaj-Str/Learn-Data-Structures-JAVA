## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concept of a linked list in Java.

In Java, a linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation and can dynamically grow or shrink as needed.

Here's an example of creating and using a linked list in Java:

```java
//@p4n.in
public class LinkedListExample{
    // Node class to represent individual nodes in the linked list
    static class Node {
        int data;   // The value stored in the node
        Node next;  // Reference to the next node

        public Node(int data) {
            this.data = data;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a linked list
        Node head = new Node(10);
        Node second = new Node(20);
        Node third = new Node(30);

        // Linking the nodes together
        head.next = second;
        second.next = third;

        // Traversing and printing the linked list
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.println(current.data);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we define a `Node` class to represent individual nodes in the linked list. Each `Node` has a `data` field to store the value and a `next` field to store the reference to the next node.

To create a linked list, we create instances of the `Node` class and connect them by setting the `next` references. In the example, we create three nodes: `head` with a value of 10, `second` with a value of 20, and `third` with a value of 30. Then, we link them together by setting `head.next` to `second` and `second.next` to `third`.

To traverse and print the linked list, we start from the `head` node and iterate through the list by following the `next` references. We use a `current` variable to keep track of the current node being processed. The loop continues until we reach the end of the list, which is indicated by a `null` value in the `next` field of the last node.

When executing the example, it will print the values of the linked list: 10, 20, and 30.

Linked lists are advantageous for dynamic data structures where frequent insertions and deletions are performed. However, they have slower access times compared to arrays when accessing elements at specific indices.

It's worth noting that this example shows a basic implementation of a singly linked list where each node only has a reference to the next node. There are other variations like doubly linked lists where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes, and circular linked lists where the last node's `next` reference points back to the head of the list.
